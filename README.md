_I am not the haxe.io author_

Mobile frontend of the haxe.io website.

The website is minimalist, responsive and already really good as a web page but it was a fun little covid-19 confinement project.

I am a long time haxe user but ironically it's made in Dart/Flutter.

Objectives there were to keep the original layout, not using webviews (markdown is actually rendered with the flutter engine) and keeping most functionality.

What might be interesting to dig are post edits from the app & push notifications for new posts.
