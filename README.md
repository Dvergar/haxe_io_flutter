# haxe_io_flutter

_I am not the haxe.io author_

Mobile frontend of the haxe.io website.

The website is already minimalist, responsive and actually really good as a web page but it was still a fun little covid-19 confinement project.

I am a long time haxe user but as weird as it might sounds the app is actually not made in haxe but in Dart/Flutter which is also an awesome tech.

Objectives there were to keep the original layout, not using webviews (markdown is actually rendered with the flutter engine) and keeping most functionality.

What might be interesting to dig are post edits from the app & push notifications for new posts.

## To do

* Make proper link colors for various domains
* Make a json renderer for the Ludum Dares
* Fix articles filter
